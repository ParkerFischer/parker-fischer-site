              <p >I am very excited to start working with my fellow cohort members at Thinkful! One of the things that made Thinkful my #1 bootcamp was the mentorship programs and community!</p>

              <p>After graduating high school I started to play tours around the midwest as a hired gun guitar and piano player. I was able to play shows at the historic Rave Theater in Milwaukee and the Varsity Theater in Dinky Town Minneapolis.</p>
